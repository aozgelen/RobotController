Introduction:
	This program is a collection of low-level control functions of a robot. Each robot 
    	posess different type of sensors and hardware, therefore the some of these behaviors
    	may not be available and/or may execute differently depending on the platform.
    	Low level behaviors implemented: 
    	1. Localization: vision-based version development is in progress. TODO: ranger-based 
    	2. Path planning: given a map builds a navigation graph and finds the shortest path.  
    	3. Obstacle avoidance: Not implemented yet TODO. 
    	4. Mapping: TODO 
    	5. Perception: Vision-based version TODO: ranger
    	6. Controller: basic behavior control
       	Also, to for debugging a visual debugger tool is available. 


Compiling:
	0. cd into 'modules' dir.
	1. Run 'make' to build the libraries and the .controller executable
    	2. Run 'make clean' to delete object files and the controller (doesn't rm libraries)
    	3. Run 'make purge' to delete all *.a files from lib directory. 
   	4. TODO: Run 'make docs' to install the documentation files into the /doc directory.

Usage:
	1. Run ./controller with:
	    -d option (optional) to run with the visual debugger
	    -f option to specify the location of the configuration file. This file contains
	       * ip and port information of the central server
	       * map filename and path
	       * an entry for each robot containing:
	       	 i. ip and port information of the player server
		 ii. robot's label
		 iii. robot's type (aibo, surveyor, scribbler, nxt)
